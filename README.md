# Random Quote Generator 
In this task, we will use JavaScript to create a simple web page that generates random quotes. The user can click a button to generate a new quote, which will be displayed on the page.

--- 

## Instructions
1. Create an array of at least 5 quotes. Each quote should be a string.

2. Use JavaScript to add an event listener to the button element.<br> When the user clicks the button, generate a random number between 0 and the length of the quotes array.

3. Use the random number to select a quote from the quotes array.

4. Create a `div` container with the `id` of `quote-container`.

5. Create a new `p` element and add the `id` property of `quote-text` to it.

6. Set the text content of the new `p` element to the selected quote.

7. Add the new `p` inside the `div` container.

8. Test your page to make sure the button generates a new quote each time it is clicked.
